# inventory-app

This app emulates an adoption site, but uses dragons as the content. 

My purpose in creating this app is to practice using the MVC model and write functions that perform CRUD operations. 

This project was made with Node, Express, Mongoose, Pug, and Tailwind.

Note that the initial page load will take about ~30 seconds due to being hosted on the free tier at onrender.
